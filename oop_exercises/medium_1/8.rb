Update the given Card class so it can be used to determine levels of rank
- Numeric cards are low ordered 2-10
- 10 < J < Q < K < A
- Suit does not effect card rank
- If an array contains two cards of matchin rank, min or max should return one of them
- Create a to_s method that returns a string like "Jack of Diamonds"

# Algorithm:
- Create a public to_s method that outputs a string representation of the card
- Define comparison methods that compares the value we are interested in
- Define min and max methods based on those comparison methods
- Define a method to evalutate equivalence
- Define a rank method that returns the rank of the card
- Should be integer for number cards or string for face cards
- Create a constant array of the order of ranks
- We can refer to index of this constant when performing comparison and sorting
