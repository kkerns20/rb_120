# ZetCode Ruby OOP Part 1

*Object-oreinted programming (OOP)*
: a programming paradigm that uses objects and their interactions to design applications and computer programs.

The basic programming concepts in OOP are:
  - Abstraction
  - Polymorphism
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance

*abstraction*
: simplifying complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem

*polymorphism* 
: the process of using an operator or function in differnt ways for different data input

*encapsulation*
: hides the implementation details of a class from other objects

*inheritance*
: a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined
