# Polymorphism and Encapsulation #

## Polymorphism ##

**Polymorphism**
: the ability for objects of a different types to respond in different ways to the same method calls (or other messaging). Put another way, polymorphism is how various objects of different classes have different functionality (aka implementation), but these same objects/classes share a *common interface*.

Polymorphism happens when we can call a method without caring about the type of a calling object. Basically, when two or more different object types have a method of the same name, we can invoke that method on any of the objects. The results may be the same, or the results may be more specific to that particular object type, but the *message* we use (the method call) to invoke the behavior is the same, which is the essence of polymorphism.
